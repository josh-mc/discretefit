Description: Implements fast, Monte Carlo simulations for 
    goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests for discrete distributions. This 
    includes tests based on the root-mean-square statistic, the 
    Chi-squared statistic, the log-likelihood-ratio statistic (G^2), and 
    the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.
