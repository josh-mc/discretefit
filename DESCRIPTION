Description: Implements fast, Monte Carlo simulations for 
    goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests for discrete distributions. This 
    includes tests based on the root-mean-square statistic, the 
    Chi-squared statistic, the log-likelihood-ratio (G^2) statistic,
    the Freeman-Tukey (Hellinger-distance) statistic, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
    statistic, and the Cramer-von Mises statistic.
