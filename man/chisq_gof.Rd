\title{Simulated p-values for Chi Squared goodness-of-fit}
\usage{
chisq_gof(x, p, reps = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\itemize{
\item a numeric vector that contains counts for each bin/category.
}}

\item{p}{\itemize{
\item a numeric vector that contains probabilities for each bin/category. .
}}

\item{reps}{\itemize{
\item an integer specifying the number of Monte Carlo simulations to perform.
The default is set to 10,000 which is appropriate for exploratory analysis.
A higher number of simulations should be selected for final analysis.
